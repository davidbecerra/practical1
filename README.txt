To do before next meet-up:
	- DAVID: implement LASSO method and pass it onto Wentao
	- CONRAD: implement cross-validation (maybe minimizing method?)
	- WENTAO: implement Elastic Net method (or add onto LASSO method?)

Possible expansions:
	- investigate extracting different features using RDKit
	- figure out how to visualize data
